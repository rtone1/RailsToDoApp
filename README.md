# RailsToDoApp
This is a to-do's application that reminds users of tasks they have to accomplish. There are two sections that give users an easy way to track what they have accomplish and see what they have not yet completed.

Built on Ruby on Rails for the back end and HTML and CSS on the client side. By using Active Record scoping the application presents to-do's in order from they where created and shift them to the completed section when a user checks them as completed. Media queries where also implemented to provide a responsive desing allowing users a way to see to-do's on the go.

#Upcoming Features 
In the near future authentication will be added in order to provide individual users a way to save their own to-do's through sessions and timestamps will get sliced to provide users with cleaner data.
