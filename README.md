# RailsToDoApp
This is a to-do's application that reminds users of tasks they have to accomplish. There are two sections that give users an easy way to track what they have accomplish and see what they have not yet completed.

Built on Ruby on Rails for the back end and HTML and CSS on the client side. By using Active Record scoping the application presents to-do's in order from they where created and shift them to the completed section when a user checks them as completed. Media queries where also implemented to provide a responsive desing allowing the user a way to see his/her task on the go.
